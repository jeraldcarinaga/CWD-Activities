                    <h4>TEMPERATURE AND HEAT</h4>
                    <p class="a">
                        The concept of temperature is rooted in qualitative ideas of “hot” and “cold”
                        based on our sense of touch. A body that feels hot usually has a higher temperature than a similar body that feels cold. That’s pretty vague, and the senses can be
                        deceived. But many properties of matter that we can measure depend on temperature. The length of a metal rod, steam pressure in a boiler, the ability of a wire to
                        conduct an electric current, and the color of a very hot glowing object—all these
                        depend on temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        Temperature is also related to the kinetic energies of the molecules of a material. In general this relationship is fairly complex, so it’s not a good place to start
                        in defining temperature. In Chapter 18 we will look at the relationship between
                        temperature and the energy of molecular motion for an ideal gas. It is important
                        to understand, however, that temperature and heat can be defined independently
                        of any detailed molecular picture. In this section we’ll develop a macroscopic
                        definition of temperature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        To use temperature as a measure of hotness or coldness, we need to construct
                        a temperature scale. To do this, we can use any measurable property of a system
                        that varies with its “hotness” or “coldness.” Figure 17.1a shows a familiar system
                        that is used to measure temperature. When the system becomes hotter, the colored
                        liquid (usually mercury or ethanol) expands and rises in the tube, and the value of
                        L increases. Another simple system is a quantity of gas in a constant-volume container (Fig. 17.1b). The pressure p, measured by the gauge, increases or decreases
                        as the gas becomes hotter or colder. A third example is the electrical resistance R
                        of a conducting wire, which also varies when the wire becomes hotter or colder.
                        Each of these properties gives us a number (L, p, or R) that varies with hotness
                        and coldness, so each property can be used to make a thermometer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        To measure the temperature of a body, you place the thermometer in contact
                        with the body. If you want to know the temperature of a cup of hot coffee, you
                        stick the thermometer in the coffee; as the two interact, the thermometer becomes
                        hotter and the coffee cools off a little. After the thermometer settles down to a
                        steady value, you read the temperature. The system has reached an equilibrium
                        condition, in which the interaction between the thermometer and the coffee causes
                        no further change in the system. We call this a state of thermal equilibrium.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        If two systems are separated by an insulating material or insulator such as
                        wood, plastic foam, or fiberglass, they influence each other more slowly. Camping coolers are made with insulating materials to delay the ice and cold food
                        inside from warming up and attaining thermal equilibrium with the hot summer
                        air outside. An ideal insulator is a material that permits no interaction at all
                        between the two systems. It prevents the systems from attaining thermal equilibrium if they aren’t in thermal equilibrium at the start. An ideal insulator is just
                        that, an idealization; real insulators, like those in camping coolers, aren’t ideal, so
                        the contents of the cooler will warm up eventually.

                        The kitchen is a great place to learn about how the properties of matter depend on temperature. 
                        When you boil water in a tea kettle, the increase in temperature produces steam that whistles out of the spout at high pressure. 
                        If you forget to poke holes in a potato before baking it, the high-pressure steam produced inside the potato can cause it to 
                        explode messily. Water vapor in the air can condense into droplets of liquid on the sides of a glass of ice water; if the glass
                        is just out of the freezer, frost will form on the sides as water vapor changes to a solid.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        These examples show the relationships among the large-scale or macroscopic
                        properties of a substance, such as pressure, volume, temperature, and mass. But
                        we can also describe a substance using a microscopic perspective. This means
                        investigating small-scale quantities such as the masses, speeds, kinetic energies,
                        and momenta of the individual molecules that make up a substance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        The macroscopic and microscopic descriptions are intimately related. For
                        example, the (microscopic) forces that occur when air molecules strike a solid
                        surface (such as your skin) cause (macroscopic) atmospheric pressure. To produce standard atmospheric pressure of Pa, molecules strike your
                        skin every day with an average speed of over 1700 km/h (1000 mi/h)!

                    <p class="a">
                        In this chapter we’ll begin our study of the thermal properties of matter by
                        looking at some macroscopic aspects of matter in general. We’ll pay special
                        attention to the ideal gas, one of the simplest types of matter to understand.
                        Using our knowledge of momentum and kinetic energy, we’ll relate the macroscopic properties of an ideal gas to the microscopic behavior of its individual
                        molecules. We’ll also use microscopic ideas to understand the heat capacities of
                        both gases and solids. Finally, we’ll take a look at the various phases of matter—
                        gas, liquid, and solid—and the conditions under which each occurs.

                        Every time you drive a car, turn on an air conditioner, or cook a meal, you
                        reap the practical benefits of thermodynamics, the study of relationships
                        involving heat, mechanical work, and other aspects of energy and energy
                        transfer. For example, in a car engine heat is generated by the chemical reaction
                        of oxygen and vaporized gasoline in the engine’s cylinders. The heated gas
                        pushes on the pistons within the cylinders, doing mechanical work that is used to
                        propel the car. This is an example of a thermodynamic process.

                        The first law of thermodynamics, central to the understanding of such
                        processes, is an extension of the principle of conservation of energy. It broadens
                        this principle to include energy exchange by both heat transfer and mechanical
                        work and introduces the concept of the internal energy of a system. Conservation
                        of energy plays a vital role in every area of physical science, and the first law has
                        extremely broad usefulness. To state energy relationships precisely, we need the
                        concept of a thermodynamic system. We’ll discuss heat and work as two means of
                        transferring energy into or out of such a system.

                    <h4>THE SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS</h4>
                    <p class="a">
                        Many thermodynamic processes proceed naturally in one direction but
                        not the opposite. For example, heat by itself always flows from a hot
                        body to a cooler body, never the reverse. Heat flow from a cool body to
                        a hot body would not violate the first law of thermodynamics; energy would be
                        conserved. But it doesn’t happen in nature. Why not? As another example, note
                        that it is easy to convert mechanical energy completely into heat; this happens
                        every time we use a car’s brakes to stop it. In the reverse direction, there are
                        plenty of devices that convert heat partially into mechanical energy. (An automobile engine is an example.) But no one has ever managed to build a machine that
                        converts heat completely into mechanical energy. Again, why not?
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        The answer to both of these questions has to do with the directions of thermodynamic processes and is called the second law of thermodynamics. This
                        law places fundamental limitations on the efficiency of an engine or a power
                        plant. It also places limitations on the minimum energy input needed to operate
                        a refrigerator. So the second law is directly relevant for many important practical
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <p class="a">
                        We can also state the second law in terms of the concept of entropy, a quantitative measure of the degree of disorder or randomness of a system. The idea of
                        entropy helps explain why ink mixed with water never spontaneously unmixes
                        and why we never observe a host of other seemingly possible processes.
